```javascript
test('talks should have unique names', () => {
  talks.push({name: 'Tests Suck', time: '14:00'});
  talks.push({name: 'React Sucks', time: '11:00'});
  talks.push({name: 'JS Sucks', time: '22:00'});
  const addDup = () => talks.push({name: 'Tests Suck', time: '14:00'});
  expect(talks.all()).toEqual([
    {name: 'React Sucks', time: '11:00'},
    {name: 'Tests Suck', time: '14:00'},
    {name: 'JS Sucks', time: '22:00'},
  ]);
  expect(addDup).toThrowError(/dup/);
});
